He is able to do so in his hideout. Hideout places have 3 levels, starting from level 1, and you upgrade them to level 3 with different items. There are exceptions to this. Stash goes up to level 4, and some special places level up to level 1. Let's look at some basic hideout places that everyone should have:
       
        <img src="IMAGES/Workbench.webp" alt="Image of Workbench icon" width="50" style="float:left;"> Workbench: In your Workbench, you craft things like guns and ammunition. Leveling Workbench unlocks more and better ammo crafts, as well as more profitable crafts.

        <img src="IMAGES/Medstation.webp" alt="Image of Medstation icon" width="50"> Medstation: In medstation, you are able to craft anything that is related to medication. From First aid kits, to Salewas, to Portable Defiblirators and LEDX Skin Transilluminators. Higher levels of Medstation give access to better medication crafts, and stimulant crafts.

        <img src="IMAGES/Lavatory.webp" alt="Image of Lavatory icon" width="50"> Lavatory: In Lavatory, you are able to craft things related to fabrics. From backpacks, to body armors, and tactical rigs. Also able to craft simpler fabrics, such as the Ripstop or the Fleece. Higher levels of Lavatory give access to better armor and backpack crafts. 

        <img src="IMAGES/Stash.webp" alt="Image of Stash icon" width="50"> Stash: This is your main storage. The higher level the level of your stash, the more storage you have to put stuff in. Also, the higher the edition you have purchased, the bigger the storage level you will have from the beginning. Note: Leveling up your stash is super expensive, so, if you want to have more storage, I simply recommend you buy higher editions of the game.

        <img src="IMAGES/Gym.webp" alt="Image of Gym icon" width="50"> Gym: This is your Gym. Newly added, The Gym currently trains your Strength and Endurance (Which also level up your health). The gym currently only has 1 level, however it will be upgradeable soon.

        <img src="IMAGES/Intelligence_Center.webp" alt="Image of Intelligence icon" width="50"> Intelligence Center: Your Intelligence Center serves a variety of tasks. At level 1, you are not able to craft anything, however, you gain more money off of tasks, and you are able to get on Scav runs faster. At higher levels, while these bonuses are enhanced, you are also able to craft high-quality items, such as flash drives, keycards, and more.

        <img src="IMAGES/Nutrition_Unit.webp" alt="Image of Nutrition Unit icon" width="50"> Nutrition Unit: The Nutrition Unit, as you may have figured, provides provision and drink crafts. At higher levels, you gain more crafts that are more profitable, and also some barter item crafts.

        <img src="IMAGES/Shooting_Range.webp" alt="Image of Shooting Range icon" width="50"> Shooting Range: This is your shooting range. Here, you are able to test on your guns without using ammunition. Higher levels provide more targets and targets far away to shoot at, as well as cameras for the far away targets, adding paper targets that are replaceable, and also adding the ability to train, by moving the targets around for shooting practice.

        <img src="IMAGES/Illumination.webp" alt="Image of Illumination icon" width="50"> Illumination: This is your lights. There is a base level 0 which uses candles for illumination, however once you start upgrading it, you start gaining better-quality lights, from simple bulbs to entire lamps.
