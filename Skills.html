Skills have 3 states when leveling them in raid: The first state is when you haven't leveled the skill at all during that raid, in which you gain 129% of normal skill points until you get the first skill point. After the first skill point, you gain the normal skill points for 1 skill point. After these 2 skill points, you will reach a state where you get less than 100% of the skill points. The leveling speed is then calculated by using the formula: 0.6(Earned Points - 1)*100 where earned points are rounded down to the nearest digit. After not earning any skill points for 200 seconds, the modifier will reset for said skill. However it will just reset to 100% of skill points earnt, not 129%. Character Skills level up to level 51, with 51 being the Elite skill status. Those skills break into categories, including: <b>Combat, Mental, Physical, Practical,</b> and <b>Special.</b>

Tip: firing ~30 rounds during a raid will give you enough points and will reach the skill to the diminishing returns part.
