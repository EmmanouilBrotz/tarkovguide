As you can see by the image on the left, your PMC can hold: Earpiece, Headwear, Face Cover, Armband, Body Armor, Eyewear, A holster for a pistol, 2 guns (One on sling and one on back), a sheath for a melee weapon, a tactical rig, pockets, special slots, backpack and pouch.
                    Earpiece: This is where your headset goes. Headsets generally help with reducing environmental sounds (such as rain or wind) and gunshots, and amplify sounds such as footsteps. There are various headsets to choose from, which are mostly preference.
                    Headwear: This is where you equip your ballistic protection for your head. While you can also use things such as beanies and caps, in order to gain ballistic protection, you must wear a helmet.
                    Face Cover: You equip your balaclava here. Balaclavas help hide your face in order to not be as visible to the enemy. You can also wear Tagilla's mask, however you won't be able to wear any glasses, helmets, or headsets.
                    Armband: This is where you equip armbands. Armbands are mostly used for identification when in squads.
                    Body Armor: This is where your ballistic vest goes. Obviously offers ballistic protection.
                    Eyewear: This is where your glasses go. Glasses can help against flashbangs (to reduce their effect), or they can offer minimal ballistic protection by having a low richochet chance.
                    On Sling/ On Back: This is where your guns go. You can have up to 1 gun on your sling, and 1 on your back.
                    Holster: This is where your sidearm goes. You can have up to 1 sidearm on your holster.
                    Sheath: This is where your melee weapon goes. There aren't that many uses for melee weapons, however there are some extracts that require specific melee weapons (e.g Cliff Descent on Reserve requires a Red Rebel Ice Pick).
                    Tactical Rig: This is where your Tactical Rig goes. In this rig, you will have your magazines, and medicine. You can also wear rigs that have ballistic protection, however you will not be able to wear body armors. 
                    Pockets: These are your pockets, you can fit 4 single-slot items. You can place stuff like grenades and medication here.
                    Special Slots: These are your special slots, slots reserved for special items, such as items needed for quests (Markers, Jammers, Radio Repeaters) and other useful tools that you may need in your raids (Range-finder, Compass, Multi-tools).
                    Backpack: This is where your backpack goes. The backpack serves you as an item to store things in.
                    Pouch: This is where your secure container goes. Whatever you put in here, you will not lose upon death. Certain items may not be placed here.
