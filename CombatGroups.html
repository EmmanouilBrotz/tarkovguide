      <p style="margin-top:-50px; font-size:larger;"> In Tarkov, there are multiple groups that fight each other, while they are attempting to escape the region.

        <strong style="font-size:larger;">The Groups consist of:</strong>
          <ul style="font-size:large">
            <li> <b>Scavengers:</b> Also named Scavs, they are Russian civillians that either decided to stay in
               Tarkov to cause havoc, or couldn't get out of it in time, and are now stuck in the region. They
                usually roam around Tarkov with what they had in their home, or anything they found around
               that can kill. They are usually not trained in warfare, and are therefore most of the times not
               able to stand a chance against anyone.<hr></li>
               
            <li><b>PMCs:</b> Namely Private Military Contractors, they are Contractors that work in a Private Military Company that have been hired by other groups for their bidding. Specifically, we have: <ul>
              <li><b>USEC:</b> The (U)nited (SEC)urity, or USEC in short, is a company formed by the merge of
                 two other companies in 1999, KerniSEC and Safe Sea. The USEC were known for their
                 scale with long-range optics, their tactics, their deep knowledge in weapon modding,
                 their negotiation skills, and their use of excellent AR systems, such as the M4A1, the HK
                  416A5, the RSASS, and more. In 2004, the USEC made contact with an agent of a
                 popular group, named TERRAGROUP, a group of rich individuals who engaged in
                 various businesses. They hired the USEC as their private army, to guard their
                 transports. With over 7500 strong staff in their company, their primary objective while
                 working for TERRAGROUP was to destroy any evidence of any potentially illegitimate
                 activity by its employer and protect its property from being captured by BEAR operatives.</li>
              <li><b>BEAR:</b> The Battle Encounter Assault Regiment, or BEAR, is a Private Military Company, and the opposing combat group of the USEC. The Company was established by a secret decree of the Russian Federation Government as a countermeasure against illegal activites of the TERRAGROUP in Russian territory. </li>
            </ul><hr></li>
            
            <li><b>ex-PMCs:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Raiders:</b> Raiders are often groups of ex-PMCs (BEARs and USEC) and locals (Scavs), and often considered stronger than Scavengers. They often patrol the Lab and Reserve in small groups, not afraid of dealing with any intruding PMCs. They have a large arsenal of weapons, as most of them come from Private Military Companies, ranging from various Assault Rifles (such as the G36C, AUG A3, MK47 Mutant, AS VAL, various AKs, M4s, HK 416A5), DMRs (SR-25, RFB), Shotguns (Saiga, MP-153,M870, MP-133), SMGs (MP7A2, Vector, P90, MP5, MP9-N), and they have a sidearm with them at all times. Their tactics involve flanking the enemy, pushing and pinning down the enemy, and more advanced tactics.
                 </li>
              <li><b>Rogues:</b> Rogues are a faction of ex-PMCs, specifically ex-USEC, who can only be found in Lighthouse, guarding a water treatment plant they have kept theirs as a base of operations ever since they abandoned the Private Military Company. In terms of equipment, they are pretty much equivalent to the Raiders, except they also have the MK 16 SCAR-L in their arsenal. They usually fire at BEAR operators on sight, however they will refrain from firing at USECs unless if they get close to the water treatment, or if they are fired upon. They have mounted Heavy Machine Guns (NSV) and Automatic Grenade Launchers (AGS-30s) installed in the water treatment, making their approach difficult. </li>
            </ul><hr></li>
            
            <li><b>Bosses:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Reshala:</b> Reshala, or else the Dealmaker (or Problem Solver) is a fixer, but with focus on using connections and reputation to secure and speed along deals of any kind. He communicates with all the other bosses and he is usually a broker for deals in between factions. He spawns in Customs, either Dorms (3-story or 2-story) or the Gas Station. He has 4 heavily armed guards, who used to work in the military. His guards' last names are all "Zavodskoy", which in russian means "From Factory". Reshala's guards wear police uniforms which have been recognized as Russian Roadside Police. Reshala hides behind his guards, and lets them do their job. His guards have AKs most of the time, with some kind of ballistic protection, while Reshala himself has no ballistic protection, but packs a good punch with his arsenal.</li>
              <li><b>Killa:</b> Killa is the one of the two bosses in the entire game who has no bosses to protect him. He likes to get his hands dirty. He spawns on Interchange, with no particular spot to spawn whatsoever. He was a former athlete (hence why he likes wearing tracksuits), is Tagilla's elder brother, and packs a lot of ballistic protection, wearing some heavy armour, and a helmet with a faceshield for extreme ballistic protection. As for his arsenal, he uses a lot of grenades to pinch the enemy, covering his footsteps as he pushes the enemy. He suppresses the enemy while he's at it, making him a very dangerous enemy.</li>
              <li><b>Tagilla:</b>Killa's little brother, he roams in factory with more ballistic protection than his brother. He was a former employee of the Chemical Plant No.16 (Which is the Factory location, hence why he sits there), and is a very aggressive boss. That can be explained due to the fact that he was an employee in said Chemical Plant, due to the fact that the TERRAGROUP was experimenting and producing various chemicals for drug research, and exposure to such chemicals cause aggression. He also wields a hammer, which he swings out and runs towards his enemies, as they cower in fear. </li>
              <li><b>Shturman:</b>Shturman, or "Navigator" in Russian, spawns in Woods, near a Sawmill by a lake. He has 2 guards, all of which their last name is Svetloozerskiy, which means "Light Lake" or "Lake of Light", which is said to be the lake they are close to. Both Shturman and his guards all have DMRs, or Assault Carbines, but barely any ballistic protection, because they rely on spreading out and scouting, and making sure they are able to spot the enemy before the enemy spots them. They usually sit in bushes, which makes it harder for them to be seen, along with the camo they wear, such as Green Shemaghs, Green armour, etc. Since they have DMRs/ACs, they are deadly accurate.</li>
              <li><b>Glukhar:</b>Glukhar, or in Russian "Wood Grouse" (The largest bird in the Grouse Family), or also a cold case in Russian police slang, is one of the hardest bosses in the game due to the amount of guards he has, and the organization he has for them. He usually has 6 guards, he keeps 2 close to him as security, 2 to aggressively push the enemy once one has been spotted (Worth noting they are all very accurate and observant), and keeps the last two as replacements, or to command at his will, with whatever situation he may get in. Glukhar himself doesn't have much ballistic protection, however his arsenal allows him to engage both long-range and close-range encounters, making him deadly at any range. His guards are also heavily armed and fortified, which may require your caution when engaging them.</li>
              <li><b>Sanitar:</b> Sanitar, or "Orderly" in Russian, which is a term for a healthcare assistant for medical staff, is a boss that spawns in Shoreline, mainly in the Health Resort, the Pier, or his Villas. He has 2 guards, and are rumored to be medical professionals, as most of their names are medical professions. Sanitar refers to them as colleagues, even. While Sanitar is not armed all that much, however his VSS can easily kill you. His guards however can be heavily guarded, however their weapons aren't all that much of a threat. Both him and his guards may contain medical items to assist you on your tasks, or your raids.</li>
              <li><b>Goons:</b> The Goons consist of a small squad of 3 people: Birdeye, Knight and Big Pipe. 

              <b>Big Pipe</b> is the most aggressive of the three, and immediately rushes the enemies upon spotting them. He has a lot of ballistic protection, and may also pack a Rotary Grenade Launcher, which is a very dangerous weapon, arguably one of the most dnagerous weapons in all of Tarkov. 
              <b>Birdeye</b> is the scout of the trio. He usually runs with a DMR or a Sniper Rifle, with an AR on his back. He sits back and communicates with his teammates through the radio, for any enemies he spots.
              <b>Knight</b> is the commander of the Goons, and usually commands the other two around. He also is aggressive, however he is more tactical and more efficient than Big Pipe.
              In total, the three are very strategic with how they move and how they fight, and acknowledge their arsenal and use positions to their advantage.</li>
              <li><b>Zryachiy:</b> Zryachiy, which loosely translates to "The one who sees", is the most mysterious boss in all of Tarkov. He guards the Lightkeeper, who is located on the Lighthouse map, and has 2 guards around him, in case of any conflicts. Once any of his guards die, he is able to call 4 more guards to his command. If you have a Digital secure DSP radio transmitter, he will not shoot at you, as that indicates that you are here to make business with the Lightkeeper. It is being rumored that he has a connection with the cultists, though nothing is confirmed.</li>
            </ul><hr></li>
            
            
            <li><b>Cultits:</b> One of the most mysterious factions in the game, the cultists are mostly found in maps like the Woods, Shoreline, Customs, and Factory at night-time. They do not engage on any Scavs, Bosses or their guards, and only decide to engage on any PMCs. They will not fire or throw grenades at you unless if you fire upon them, however they will sneak behind you and stab you with their knives, which poison you. They are cold-blooded, and cannot be seen on Thermals, and make no noise when they walk or run. Even when they have to fire, they are very dangerous, since they run suppressed weapons, with high-tier ammunition. None of their names are revealed, as they are all named "Sektants", which are roughly translated to "Cultits", and their leader, Zhrets, roughly translates to a priest that performs sacrifices and doesn't serve the Christian God.</li>
